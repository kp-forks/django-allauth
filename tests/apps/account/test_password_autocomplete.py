"""
Regression tests for autocomplete="new-password" on the password
confirmation field.

Password managers and browsers use autocomplete="new-password" to identify
the field(s) that a freshly suggested password should be filled into. When
only the first password field carries the attribute, a suggested password is
filled into password1 but not password2, forcing the user to copy/type the
confirmation by hand. Both fields of a "set a new password" pair must
therefore carry the same autocomplete value.
